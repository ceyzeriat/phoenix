=================

This simple project is an example repo for Python projects.

Setting it up:
    * Download the zip of the project using `this link`_
    * Unzip it where you want your project to be stored
    * Rename the root folder ``mv phoenix-master othername`` and CD into it
    * [if need be] give the ``setup.sh`` script the execution rights ``chmod 744 setup.sh``
    * Run ``./setup.sh`` to display the help on how to proceed with the replacements of tags
    * Edit the ``<packagename>/_meta.py`` file
    * [optional] delete the README.bak file (this README file after the setup script ran)
    * [optional] initialize your git repo ``git init``, and do your initial commit
